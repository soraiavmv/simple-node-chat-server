# Node.js Simple Chat Server

A very basic chat server application developed using Node.js with Socket.io

## Installation

Use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install and run the app.

```bash
yarn install
```
## Run
You can build your own client if you want to, but if you just want to try it, a simple client application is also provided in this package. Just run both processes with yarn and enjoy.

```bash
# to run the server
yarn server

# to run the client; the server can accept a maximum of 10 client connections
yarn client
```
